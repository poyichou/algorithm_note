# Note for algorithm  
## Brute-force (Exhausive):  
	Examine the entire set of possible solutions explicitly  
	A victim to show the efficiences of the following methods  
## Greedy:  
	Build up a solution incrementally, myopically optimizing some local criterion.  
	Optimization problems that can be solved correctly by a greedy algorithm are very rare.  
## Divide and Conquer:  
	Break up a problem in two sub-problems solve, each sub-problem independently, and combine solution to sub-problems to form solution to original problem.  
## Dynamic programming:  
	Break up a problem into a series of overlapping sub-problems, and build up solutions to larger and larger sub-problem  
# To run:  
running `make` at root directory would generate all excutable files in corresponding dirctory  
just run any of them to see the result  
## note: there would be no excutable files in tool/
