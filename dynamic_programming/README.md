Smart Recursion: in a nutshell, dynamic programming is recursion without repetition.
	Dynamic programming is NOT about filling in tables; it's about smart recursion.
	Dynamic programming algorithms store the solutions of intermediate subproblems often but not always in some kind of array or table.
	A common mistake: focusing on the table (because tables are easy and familiar) instead of the much more important (and difficult) task of finding a correct recurrence.
If the recurrence is wrong, or if we try to build up answers in the wrong order, the algorithm will NOT work
